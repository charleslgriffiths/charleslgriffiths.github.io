						<h3>Projects</h3>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>SenseFit <span>(COMP6013)</span></h4>
							<p>
								Developing SenseFit – a machine learning-powered mobile application designed to predict injury risks for amateur and semi-professional athletes. Unlike existing solutions tailored for elite sports, SenseFit focuses on accessibility and usability. The app analyzes key biometric data such as heart rate variability (HRV), sleep quality, and fatigue levels to provide personalized injury risk assessments and proactive training recommendations. It integrates advanced ML models like Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to detect trends and optimize injury prevention strategies. Built with React Native, the application ensures a seamless user experience while prioritizing data security and GDPR compliance.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Python, React Native, JavaScript, Agile Project Management, Presentation Skills, Expo</p>

							<h4>Machine Learning Model Evaluation &amp; Neural Network Implementation <span>(COMP6011)</span></h4>
							<p>
								For the COMP6011 Machine Learning module, I undertook two key projects using the Palmer Penguins dataset. In the first part, I applied and compared Naïve Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers by performing data preprocessing, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis to identify the best classification model. In the second part, I implemented a neural network from scratch in R, beginning with a single-layer perceptron and extending it into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with forward propagation and backpropagation. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and training size were carefully tuned, and the model’s generalization was evaluated using validation techniques and error analysis.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Backpropagation, Hyperparameter Tuning, R</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>Robo-Uber: AI-Based Autonomous Taxi Dispatch System <span>(COMP6032)</span></h4>
							<p>
								As part of the COMP6032 Artificial Intelligence module, I developed and optimized an AI-driven autonomous taxi dispatch system named Robo-Uber. I improved upon a given baseline simulation by implementing A* search for efficient path planning and integrating a probabilistic traffic-aware routing system. Additionally, I enhanced the dispatcher’s fare allocation strategy to maximize earnings while ensuring fair taxi utilization. The bidding system was optimized through profitability-based decision-making that considered traffic conditions, fare expiry, and expected returns. This project provided hands-on experience in heuristic search algorithms, probabilistic modelling, and real-world transportation system optimization.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Artificial Intelligence, Heuristic Analysis, Python, Probabilistic Models, Path Planning</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>Data Transformation &amp; Relational Database Development <span>(COMP5011)</span></h4>
							<p>
								For the COMP5011 Databases module, I designed and implemented a comprehensive data processing pipeline in two phases:
								<br><strong>Phase 1: XML &amp; JSON Data Transformation</strong>
								<br>&bull; Converted raw customer and transaction data into XML and JSON formats for external vendors and internal web services.
								<br>&bull; Developed a Document Type Definition (DTD) to enforce XML schema validation.
								<br>&bull; Used XSLT transformations to generate structured outputs while ensuring compatibility across systems.
								<br>&bull; Applied data protection principles (GDPR/UK GDPR) and addressed legal considerations.
								<br><strong>Phase 2: Relational Database Development &amp; Analytics</strong>
								<br>&bull; Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and normalized the database (1NF &amp; 2NF) to remove redundancy.
								<br>&bull; Created and loaded data into a relational database (SQLite) from structured sources.
								<br>&bull; Developed SQL queries to extract key insights such as sales trends, customer spending, and product demand.
								<br>&bull; Optimized performance by creating a SalesSummary table to aggregate monthly sales data.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> SQL, Database Design</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>Semantic Debate Forum Web Application <span>(COMP5013)</span></h4>
							<p>
								Designed and built for the Web Application Development module, this semantic debate forum is implemented with Python (Flask) and SQLite. The application enables user registration, login, and the creation of topics and claims, as well as the sharing of discussion links. Key features include AJAX-based dynamic content updates, session-based authentication with password hashing, and robust security measures against SQL injection and XSS. The design adheres to WCAG-oriented accessibility guidelines and utilizes responsive design techniques via CSS flexbox and media queries. Comprehensive testing ensured functionality, security, and performance.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Web Application Development, Python, SQLite, AJAX, JSON, WCAG, Testing</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>ChatAdvisor <span>(COMP5022)</span></h4>
							<p>
								Developed as part of my Innovative Product Development module, ChatAdvisor is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with learning difficulties. The project integrated Microsoft Azure AI-Language for summarization alongside ChatGPT’s conversational API to create a context-aware support system. Working in a small Agile team, I contributed to the Java backend—refining a Lucene-based text search and researching industry best practices—while gaining valuable insights into software development processes.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Java, Apache Lucene, Microsoft Azure AI, Agile Project Management, GitHub, JUnit, REST APIs, Research</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>Advanced Data Structures &amp; Pathfinding Algorithms in Java <span>(COMP5017)</span></h4>
							<p>
								In the Data Structures and Algorithms module, I implemented key data structures and graph traversal algorithms to optimize data retrieval and pathfinding. This project involved creating a hash table with custom quadratic probing for efficient storage, a binary search tree (BST) for O(log n) lookups, and applying various graph traversal techniques—including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and A* search—to determine optimal paths in a simulated transport network. Performance logging, assertions, and test-driven development (TDD) were employed to compare algorithm efficiency and refine the implementations.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Java, Data Structures, Pathfinding Algorithms, Graph Traversal</p>

						<div class="project-item">
							<h4>Text Adventure Game Engine in C++ <span>(COMP5004)</span></h4>
							<p>
								As part of the Software Development with C and C++ module, I developed a text-based adventure game engine. The engine allows players to navigate through multiple rooms using directional commands (north, east, south, west), manage an inventory by picking up or dropping items, and save/load their game progress. Built in C++ with an object-oriented design, it effectively models rooms, objects, and game state, laying a solid foundation for interactive storytelling.
							</p>
